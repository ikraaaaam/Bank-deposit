# Bank-deposit
Given the details of customers in a bank, the aim is to improve bank marketing s strategies by analyzing their past marketing strategies and recommending which customers to target.
First of all, I loaded the data in jupyter notebook and put a detailed look into the data. I performed EDA vastly to look into categorical and numerical feature distribution, relationship between categorical features and label, relationship between discrete numerical features and label and also continuous numerical features and label, pair plot and so on. After getting a clear idea of my data, I performed Feature engineering into the dataset. Where I dropped the unwanted features, handled the missing values, handles categorical features, feature scaling and removed the outliers. Then after getting a clean dataset, I splitted the dataset into training and test set and then I trained the models.
